# Drupal only JS
General or common Drupal only JS should go here, you can have as many JS files here and
use libraries file to include them, otherwise as usual each JS should be in its own component.
Also if you have any polyfills that you'd like to add, just add it to `polyfill.js` file here
it is already included in the `main.script.js`

f.x: `import 'element-closest-polyfill';`
