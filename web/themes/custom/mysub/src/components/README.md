## Components directory
This is where all your templating files should live, each with its own `js`, `scss` & `twig` file.
The Drupal `attach_library` could be added here or directly in the Drupal `.html.twig` itself.

You may copy over the components that you think you might need to modify or you don't want to get them changed with each update from the parent theme over here
